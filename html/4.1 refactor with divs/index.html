            Somedays I feel so frustrated and uninspired. Basically wanting to bang my head against the wall and give up
            coding altogether. Maybe even think of a career change. But then I have that “AH-HA” moment! When I have
            finally
            solved that pesky and illusive bug that have been keeping me up for DAYS! The sense of accomplishment I feel
            in
            that moment is what keeps me going.

            I strive to improve and build a more diverse knowledge base for myself, that is why I am constantly learning
            something new.
